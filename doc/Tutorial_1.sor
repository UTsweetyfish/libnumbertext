# Soros Tutorial – Part One 🔢  Three, Two, One...
#
# INTRODUCTION
#
# Soros programming language is for number to
# number name conversion. It’s based on regular
# expressions, the popular text processing
# tool of modern programming languages. So if you
# don’t want to convert numbers to number names,
# it’s still worth to check this tutorial, because
# most parts are about regular expressions,
# giving useful information for modern C++, Java,
# JavaScript, Python etc. programming, too.
# If you know regular expressions well, you can
# jump to the last part of the tutorial!
#
# In this part, we will learn the base syntax of
# Soros, writing small programs to convert
# input numbers to numbers and colorful (at least
# in Mozilla Firefox) emojis!
#
#
#
# TASK 1 – HELLO, WORLD!
#
# A Soros program consists of program lines.
#
# A program line is an input text and an output text
# separated by (the first) space:
#
# input_text output text
#
# Following program line replaces the input text “0”
# with the output text “Hello, 🌍!”, as you can see
# in the right output list window, which shows the
# output of the first 120 integer numbers, including
# this one:

0 Hello, 🌍!

# Replace “Hello, 🌍!” with “zero” in the previous line,
# and check the same change in the right output window
# list!
#
# Write here a new program line to convert the input
# text “1” to “one”!



# TASK 2 – The early bird catches the worm.
#
# First matching program line gives result.
#
# Remove the line with the bird COMPLETELY, and
# then the line with the worm! During these, check
# the results in the right output list window!

2 🐦
2 🐛
2 two



# TASK 3 – Three blind mice
#
# Input text without matching program line, or a
# matching program line without output text
# results empty output text.
#
# Remove the character # (sign of comment line)
# before 3 in the following line to hide the mice!

# TASK 4 – Five little speckled frogs
#
# Modify the following program lines to get correct
# number of frogs for the input number 5 and 4!
